Description: 
    BioTokenizeR is a tool to help users tokenize biological sequences (DNA, 
    RNA, and protein) via biology-aware byte-pair encoding (BPE) 
    (Sennrich et al., 2016), analyzing and visualizing the tokens produced. It 
    aims to be the first R package to incorporate biological annotations into
    its merge strategy, producing biologically-meaningful tokens. It improves
    existing workflows by combining this novel tokenization with token analysis
    and exploratory visualizations in a single R package, enabling researchers
    to discover and analyze recurrent sequence patterns in a way not previously
    supported in R.
